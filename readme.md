# Go technical test

The technology used is:
- GO
- gin
- gorm
- Docker
- Unit Test (go test)
- Linter (golangci-lint)

Because everything is in containers, the execution of the project is very simple, you only need to execute the command

```sh
docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the database as well as the server and can be used without problem on port 3000

For a simpler execution, I am attaching a postman file with the different endpoints.
